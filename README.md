## Tensorflow

This branch uses standalone Keras with a Tensorflow 1.14 backend. See the `tensorflow_2` branch for the Keras within Tensorflow 2.0 version of the codebase.

## Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

The notebooks for each chapter are in the root of the repository, prefixed with the chapter number.

The `data` folder is where to download relevant data sources (chapter 3 onwards)
The `run` folder stores output from the generative models (chapter 3 onwards)
The `utils` folder stores useful functions that are sourced by the main notebooks
